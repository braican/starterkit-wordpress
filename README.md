WordPress Starter Kit
=====================

A starter kit for WordPress builds from scratch. Includes WordPress core and a custom, completely barebones theme. As in, absolutely no styling and a very basic structure.

Theme based on _s.

## Instructions
1. Do a find/replace all for `_templatename` and replace with your template name.

### a database directory?

I know there's some back and forth between whether putting a database dump into a git repo is a good idea or not, but since most WordPress database dumps are relatively small, I'm leaving this as a good solution for data in version control.

So place database dumps here.
