WordPress Starter Kit
=====================

A starter kit for WordPress builds from scratch. Includes WordPress core and a custom, completely barebones theme. As in, absolutely no styling and a very basic structure.

Theme based on _s.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Search for `'_s'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
2. Search for `_s_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _s` in style.css.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_s</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `_s-` to capture prefixed handles.

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information.


a database directory?
---------------------

I know there's some back and forth between whether putting a database dump into a git repo is a good idea or not, but since most WordPress database dumps are relatively small, I'm leaving this as a good solution for data in version control.

So place database dumps here.
