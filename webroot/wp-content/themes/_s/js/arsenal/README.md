# The Arsenal

This directory is where all javascript modules live. All available modules exist inside the `available` directory. Set up the modules you'll need in this project in the `setup.json` file in this project's root, and then run `gulp build-scripts` to copy the appropriate scripts into the `enabled` directory.
